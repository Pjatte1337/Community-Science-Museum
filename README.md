### Description
<p>This was my Semester Project where we had to make a website for a Community Science Museum.
The target audiance was children aged 7-15, and families with younger kids and schools.
The page should have at keast 4-6 pages, writing the code with semantic and neatly indented HTML, and we had to follow the DRY principles for the CSS. The site also need to be responive.</p>
